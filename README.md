## Problem Statements
In this era, we are flooded with information. To avoid it, a tool is required to classified information that we can prioritize which information we want to read / absorb.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can categorize information accurately.

## Methodology
We will use data from Reddit, namely the post in sub-Reddit askscience (https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/hot/) & science (https://www.reddit.com/r/science/hot/). 
We extract the data with webscrapper from Reddit API. Once data collected, we'll applied Natural Language Processing & classification algorithms (Naive Bayes & Logistic Regression to classify the post.

## Constraints
We selected two similar sub-Reddits to increase the difficulty level. We believe that if our model can accurately classify post from similar sub-Reddits, the model can be developed further to incorporate different sub-Reddits & perform well.

## Data / Materials
Data extracted from Reddit API is stored as "csv" file inside "data" folder.
