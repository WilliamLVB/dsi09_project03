This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

       Username: /u/foretopsail

       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology
       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. 
       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.
       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

How do we know the assumption that all visible galaxies are made of normal matter is correct?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m given to understand that antimatter behaves with itself in the same way that the equivalent regular matter does. So a large mass of anti-hydrogen could form a star, with antiproton-antiproton chain fusion forming anti-helium. Anti-photons aren&amp;#39;t really a thing since photons are not charged particles, so such an anti-star would produce light that appeared just like a regular star of equivalent mass. How would it be possible to tell the difference between an anti-star and a regular matter star from a distance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s fairly safe to assume that none of the stars in our galaxy are made of antimatter as if both were present in our galaxy we&amp;#39;d be able to witness annihilation reactions occurring as matter and antimatter collide. Yet, it seems as though it could be possible for a faraway galaxy to exist made entirely of antimatter. How would we be able to tell the difference between this and a normal galaxy?

Edit: 
Thanks for all the insightful responses.

Consensus seems to be that nutrients are important, especially in the infantile and adolescent stages, but macronutrients/calories are probably more important in adults when at least some micronutrients are coming in. And they’re probably coming in approximately satisfactory amounts if caloric needs are being met, unless you live off junk food.

Some caloric restriction as an adult can be beneficial and eating “healthy” is better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more important for the development of neurons under normal conditions? Macronutrients or micronutrients? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If being in a caloric/macronutrient deficit has a negative impact on neurological processes, does meeting your micronutrient requirements minimize that impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does being in a caloric deficit affect the atrophy of neurons prone to atrophy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what are the most important factors for the optimal function of neurological processes? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

My understanding is that burning fossil fuels is problematic because it releases carbon into the atmosphere that hasn't been in circulation for millions of years.

I've also been told similar things about oil in the hair or on the skin/face (something like: removing oil or drying it a lot might make your body produce \*more\*, etc.).

I know the body does have a lot of mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis, so it makes \*intuitive\* sense that if it has more-than-usual of something, it might change to produce less of that thing in the future; but I don't know if such mechanisms actually exist for the kinds of things people claim. (And I know usually there are multiple mechanisms at play and it's likely more complicated than any intuitive or simple explanation).

So my question is basically: if I take, say, a daily vitamin supplement (e.g., very large dose of Vit D or Vit B12), could that have the effect of making my body produce less endogenously? If I stop taking those after a year of daily ingestion, will my body end up producing less than it was prior to supplementation? And does the same thing apply for medication like a neurotransmitter agonist or antagonist?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told (perhaps wrongly?) that taking an SSRI for extended periods of time might in the long run make your body produce less serotonin endogenously (perhaps just temporarily). I&amp;#39;ve also been told similar things about oil in the hair or on the skin/face (something like: removing oil or drying it a lot might make your body produce *more*, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the body does have a lot of mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis, so it makes *intuitive* sense that if it has more-than-usual of something, it might change to produce less of that thing in the future; but I don&amp;#39;t know if such mechanisms actually exist for the kinds of things people claim. (And I know usually there are multiple mechanisms at play and it&amp;#39;s likely more complicated than any intuitive or simple explanation).&lt;/p&gt;
