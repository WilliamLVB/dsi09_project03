This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

       Username: /u/foretopsail

       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology
       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. 
       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.
       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

My name is Wray Gabel, I'm a Masters student at the University of Florida advised by Dr. Peter Frederick.

A little about my research--my thesis explores the mutualistic relationship between nesting wading birds and the American Alligator. Basically, wading birds get protection from nest predators (like racoons) and alligators get food from discarded nestlings. I'm looking to 1) better understand what alligators might be getting out of the deal and 2) how this mutualism might be changing wading bird colony location preferences when alligators are not around. I conducted my field work for part 1) in the Everglades and used existing wading bird colony location data from North and South Carolina for part 2).

A little about me--I actually grew up wanting to become a paleontologist, which was really what ignited my passion for field work and biology, but ultimately I found currently existing animals to be more fun than rocks. 

I got my undergrad degree in Biology from Skidmore College, and after graduating I worked with seabirds in Japan (Hokkaido University), wading birds/waterbirds in San Francisco (San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory), and seabirds in Maine (Audubon's Project Puffin). 

I'm mainly interested in the conservation of coastal and wetland ecosystems and hope to do something with wading bird, waterbird, and/or seabird monitoring in my future career as a wildlife biologist. I also minored in Studio Art while at Skidmore and plan to create an illustrated version of my thesis, and I'll be attending an Art-Science residency this fall!

I've been trying to google the answer to this, and so far I think I understand that when you do that elementary school science project where you make a battery to power a really small light bulb with a lemon or potato or whatever, it's using a chemical reaction between copper, zinc, and the electrolytes within the juices of the produce you're using that creates electricity (I really hope that's at least somewhat correct or I'll look even more silly than I already do). I'm wondering if, after you do that, is that potential energy that your body could use from eating whatever it is using gone, or is it using an entirely different kind of energy.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."". 

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience""&gt;The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with &amp;#39;I think&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve heard&amp;#39;, then it&amp;#39;s not suitable for &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/""&gt;please refer to the information provided here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello [r/askscience](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience)!

​

My question is, is it always better to use a higher concentration of cleaning solution? I realize this is a broad question but let me provide an example and hopefully flesh out what I'm asking.

​

Dish detergent. One school of thought I have encountered is to use as little water as possible, it's all about concentration. Try to get a ""slurry"" high in soap to cut through the grease. Another school of thought would be that you want enough cleaning solution dissolved in enough water. So to compare the two groups, they could use the same about of soap, but one with much more water. I was an amateur chemistry student, but I feel like you want there to be a lot of water as well as solvent so that there is a lot of water for your solvated grease/soap mixture to dissolve into without the concentration of the mixture becoming to high in the water. If there is too little water, I feel like you quickly run into a situation where there is a high concentration of grease on the pan, and a high concentration of grease/soap in the water, and now there is not much of a gradient, and the grease is not going to want to dissolve. Like, isn't there some equilibrium stuff going on here? Like, you wouldn't use pure soap, would you? Or maybe you would if it was actually cost effective...


So it it always better to clean something using a higher concentration of your cleaner, or are there lower concentrations that are more optimal?

Clearly this should be undetectably slow, but is it even possible for us to calculate this rate, or do we hit the breakdown of GR due to incompatibility with QM here as well?&lt;/p&gt;

The idea I had was the gun was operated by a series of step up transformers, you induce a small amount of voltage to the first coil, and use some form of lever to catapult the projectile forward. Once the round reaches the field's center, the field is collapsed, and the secondary coil is charged with a much stronger voltage (like in an ignition coil on a vehicle.) That charge goes to the second stage transformer, which creates a much stronger magnetic field (in theory) which then collapses, increasing once again the amount of voltage in the system.

The idea I had was the gun was operated by a series of step up transformers, you induce a small amount of voltage to the first coil, and use some form of lever to catapult the projectile forward. Once the round reaches the field&amp;#39;s center, the field is collapsed, and the secondary coil is charged with a much stronger voltage (like in an ignition coil on a vehicle.) That charge goes to the second stage transformer, which creates a much stronger magnetic field (in theory) which then collapses, increasing once again the amount of voltage in the system. Theoretically this could occur as many times as one wants, until the round is as fast as one desires for the effect. The voltage is then stored in capacitors after the firing sequence, and discharged for other uses. I have no idea at all if this could work, but if it could that would be a good thing to include in the book, it would make the gun more efficient because it would not need as much initial power for operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding of why the sky turns red during sunrise/sunset is as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. 

During sunrise and sunset (Figures 1 and 3), sunlight has to travel far through the atmosphere due to its angle relative to Earth's surface. 

As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it hits molecules and scatter, losing blue light in the process - sky is red. 

During midday, distance sunlight travels is lot shorter, it retains its blue light - sky is blue. 

However, if the longitudinal angle differences (time of day) and its affect on distances sunlight travel through the atmosphere ('atmospheric thickness') is the only reason why sky turns red during sunrise and sunset, why doesn't latitudinal angle differences affect the color in the same way?

&amp;#x200B;

Consider Figures 4 through 8 are at a constant longitudinal angle (same time of day).  

The northern hemisphere (lets say northern Europe) and the equator (lets say central Africa) are located on same longitude (i.e. their time zones are the same). 

During summer (Figures 4 and 5), northern Europe is not located at a latitudinal severe enough to affect distance of atmosphere sunlight has to travel - color of the sky is only affected by time of day. 

However during winter (Figure 6), sunlight has to travel the through same 'thickness' of atmosphere that it travels during sunset (Figure 3).

Therefore, during winter, the specific part of northern Europe I marked in Figures 6 and 8 should see the red sky, all day. 

And if two people are to take a picture in northern Europe and central Africa at the same time, the sky should be colored red and blue, respectively. 

But from my understanding, this is not the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earth is (almost) a sphere so any affect longitudinal angles have on 'atmospheric thickness' should be (almost) the same for latitudinal angles. 

I was thinking that maybe I could answer myself if I can picture everything in 3D, instead of just 2D as shown in my Figures. 

So longitudinal and latitudinal angles must be combined to create 'atmospheric thickness' severe enough have drastic changes in color. 

However, this is clearly not the case since latitudinal angles have little to no impact on longitudinal angles with respect to the color of the sky. 

If its time of sunrise, midday, or sunset, the colors will be same for northern Europe and central Africa. 

Sure, duration of the day are different, but the color of the sky will still be red during sunrise/sunset and blue when its midday for both places. 

If I could freeze time at 12 pm, and look up to the sky at central Africa, the sky will be blue. 

If I travel north (time still frozen), I should be seeing the sun 'setting' to the south, where one point it will be near the horizon and the sky should be red, even when its 12 pm. 

And at this location, the sky should be red all the time, as long as the sun is up, at certain time of the year (winter for northern Europe). 

I've heard of midnight sun and extremely short/long day and night time but never a place that experience red sky for a whole day, maybe I'm just ignorant on that regards.

Is there a critical exposure stage for music acquisition, after which the ability to acquire the capacity for music becomes severely limited if no musical stimulus was received during that stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I going down the wrong path by looking for parallels in language acquisition? My real question is as the post is titled: How does the capacity for music develop from infancy?&lt;/p&gt;

Consider a radio tower transmitting a carrier with no modulation, for purposes of simplicity.

I'm really tempted to say that it's a coherent source and thus tempted to see it as similar to a laser.

Lasers can be focused arbitrarily bright and hot because the source is effectively negative temperature (population inversion, etc), so thermodynamics doesn't object to it being arbitrarily focused.

But... I don't see where in the process of a radio transmitter is there anything analogous to population inversion, anything that that'd be negative temperature.

Only thing I can think of is the antenna itself in that effectively what's in it is a single mode wave nicely radiating. If some small chunk of the antenna suddenly dissipated extra energy, that'd increase the entropy in the antenna.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

Being sceptical I also try to understand the history of the field concept. At first the field was just a background on which particles (as the atoms of matter/energy) acted, but only the particles were ""real"" (basically as the test subject of the field); so the field was an abstract concept, in the same way as ""spin"" is an abstract concept.

At which point was it decided that ""the field(s)"" is a real physical entity? 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that whatever error makes the formulation of a unified theory an impossible task, was made in the 1920s/1930s. It could be a simple thing like a translation error from German to English and back, it could be a logical/mathematical error in the definitions of the concepts. It could be the guilt of Dirac who ignored the discussions which led to the Copenhagen interpretation and just kept on working on a fundamentally wrong theory, but one which works almost perfectly.

And there's no out currently because everything works too well, nobody wants to give up the field. It reminds me of the switch from Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Heliocentrism as a theory was worse back then, it took some time to iron out the problems.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Being sceptical I also try to understand the history of the field concept. At first the field was just a background on which particles (as the atoms of matter/energy) acted, but only the particles were &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; (basically as the test subject of the field); so the field was an abstract concept, in the same way as &amp;quot;spin&amp;quot; is an abstract concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At which point was it decided that &amp;quot;the field(s)&amp;quot; is a real physical entity? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that whatever error makes the formulation of a unified theory an impossible task, was made in the 1920s/1930s. It could be a simple thing like a translation error from German to English and back, it could be a logical/mathematical error in the definitions of the concepts. It could be the guilt of Dirac who ignored the discussions which led to the Copenhagen interpretation and just kept on working on a fundamentally wrong theory, but one which works almost perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no out currently because everything works too well, nobody wants to give up the field. It reminds me of the switch from Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Heliocentrism as a theory was worse back then, it took some time to iron out the problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Wheeler/Feynman didn&amp;#39;t buy the foundations of the then current physics and tried to base a theory on the &amp;quot;action at a distance&amp;quot;; but it seems that it was abandoned, seeing the success of GR and QM.&lt;/p&gt;

A: Our observation of event horizon of a black hole causes the waveform to collapse and particles to be absorbed

B: Black hole can pull waves into itself

C: Black holes 'pull' speed is so fast that technically the light red-shifts until it goes out of visible spectrum - without covering any of the distance due to moving opposite the black holes pull.

Hello AskScience! Today at approximately 10:30am local time, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake occurred in Southern California. The epicenter of the earthquake was in a remote area between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, though the quake was felt widely across the region. It is the strongest earthquake in the area in two decades. The AskScience team would like to extend our condolences to anyone negatively affected by this event. 

We are here to answer your earthquake questions! Please post them below and our panelists will join in.

Disclosure: I am half Japanese. As you know, there are a lot of historical disputes that undermines good relationships with our neighbor. To cite a few, there's the comfort women issue, the Nanjing Massacre issue, forced labor issue, etc etc.

Rather than a straight denial like it is often portrayed, the problem we have with these issues is that we feel our neighbors exagerate some aspects of them, such as the number of victims involved, the role the government actually played, etc.

Honestly, it is absolutely mind-blowing for me how past actions of our ancestors affect our future so much. My deepest desire is that we can find a groundtruth on which we can agree with our neighbor, so that we can finally have a constructive relationship. 

I was wondering therefore whether there are precedent of such situation being resolved, or some framework, perhaps involving an impartial third party, for establishing historical truth without political involvement.

So on the ISS they orbit the earth ever hour and a half, so half that time it's 'behind' the earth relative to the sun. I'm guessing it's a lot more complicated due to angles of inclination and being too high 'up' to be in the Earth's shadow. But surely sometimes the ISS is directly lined up behind the Earth hiding from the sun like a Lunar Eclipse but with the ISS. 

So the ISS would be in complete darkness. So could they then go into the Cupola room, make sure the station is pointing away from the Earth, turn out all the lights, wait for their eyes to adjust and see a wonderful view of the milky way, arguably the best view any human eyes have ever seen without using a telescope?

My name is Alicia McGrew, and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Florida.

My PhD research at the University of Florida is focused on the food web that lives inside the leaves of a carnivorous pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea).  Florida is the carnivorous plant hotspot of North America; however, this particular pitcher plant is unique, as it relies on a community of aquatic micro-organisms to help decompose its prey and acquire important nutrients for growth.

I use this model food web to ask a number of questions about ecological communities:  which organisms are there, how do they interact, and how does this composition and structure vary across different ecological and environmental conditions?  I'm particularly interested in the role of nutrients and predation on structuring aquatic communities.

I'm from Michigan, and first began doing research on aquatic communities in the Great Lakes region, where I spent many hours on a microscope!  I worked as a technician to sample and identify zooplankton taxa in a variety of habitats.  For my Master's research, I investigated the feeding ecology of an aquatic invasive species to the Great Lakes region, the bloody red shrimp.

When I'm not doing science, my other interests include teaching, reading, gardening (including a mini pitcher plant bog!), traveling, and hiking.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently wondering why this happens over and over despite me cleaning those two metals every time. I'm fidgeting with two metals disks, rubbing them together with two fingers for no real reason. One disk is certainly made of Mu-metal or similar (Coming from a high-end speaker magnet. Is not a magnet itself.) and the other disk is made from a hard, cast iron (I can barely work it with a file), that is creating yellow salts in a oxalic acid peroxide solution. (I'm sure it's Iron oxalate) So it is mostly iron.

The Mu-metal disk does not stick to the other disk, but it does when I've rubbed them together until the sludge appears. It holds on when turned on top.

I am not touching the surfaces that rub together.

I also ruled out charges because I rubbed them together while having them both connected via a copper cable.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""sludge"" appears as a darker-than-the-metal coating/film that also feels fatty.

Kind regards

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: the Mu-metal disk could be coated in zinc. It is a pretty whiteish metal.

Edit2: Interestingly, one disk slowly glides down the other when there is enough ""sludge"" to hold the disk when turned on top. For some reason it feels odd how it glides down. It is a very constant and slow motion.

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

And then when that&amp;#39;s gone, the &lt;strong&gt;liver&lt;/strong&gt; builds &lt;em&gt;ketone bodies&lt;/em&gt; from the chemical remnants of &lt;em&gt;fatty acids&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ketosis&lt;/em&gt;), and after all that - the body goes into overdrive breaking down &lt;em&gt;proteins&lt;/em&gt;; creating &lt;em&gt;amino acids&lt;/em&gt; for the body to use after converting them via the &lt;strong&gt;liver&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;em&gt;glucose&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the body doesn&amp;#39;t have enough of that to work with, it switches to our precious &lt;strong&gt;muscle&lt;/strong&gt; instead, and when the degradation of our &lt;strong&gt;muscle&lt;/strong&gt; passes a certain threshold, &lt;em&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/em&gt; is often seen as the final cause of death. But it isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;quite&amp;#39; the last resort. - The &lt;strong&gt;brain&lt;/strong&gt; can survive without the &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt; supplying &lt;em&gt;oxygen&lt;/em&gt; for upwards of three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can survive weeks on very little external nutrients. What might be the average caloric intake of our ancient human ancestors and how frequently did they go between meals?&lt;/p&gt;

In the PBS Space Time series, in the episode about the CMB, they explained the ""dots"" in the CMB are approx 1° in width, and this facts is related to having a flat spacetime.

Why ? Since spacetime works like a ""filter"" on the CMB we see, aren't there other CMB/spacetime curvature ""combinaison"" making us see the same result ?

If im not clear : if a flat spacetime gives us the CMB we see today, isn't it possible the CMB is totally different and spacetime curved in a such way we see the CMB like we do ?

Maybe I dont get something and the answer is obvious, but I had that in my head for a long time.

Hi AskScience ! I was asked by a friend to try and draw a “celtic knot” with a specific number of intersection for the thread and a specific number of holes in it. Long story short : it’s hard. But while trying to do this, I wondered about her request : was it even possible ?

&amp;#x200B;

By celtic knot, I mean a finished line that does a loop, and intersect in various places with itself (in symmetrical patterns). Something like this for example : [https://www.celtic-weddingrings.com/img/cms/celtic-love-knot.jpg](https://www.celtic-weddingrings.com/img/cms/celtic-love-knot.jpg). In this example, we have 8 “holes’ and 7 intersections. I found a few tutorials and even generators, but they don’t really answer my question. There are some celtic knots with two or three or more threads, but it might complicate the matter for now so I'm not sure it's relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would like to know is : is there a way to be sure a combination of holes and intersections is possible or impossible inside a looped line ?

&amp;#x200B;

I can say for example I want 20 holes for two intersections : it obviously is impossible, but I don’t know how to prove it and apply it to the numbers my friend gave me. I have a feeling that it is kind of a similar thing than the “*How many colors does it take to paint every region without any two adjacent ones being the same color ?’* question, but i'm absolutely not a mathematician so I might be very wrong.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/).

How does an mRNA even know where a ribosome is? And how come it's able to navigate toward such ribosome? You don't expect a rock to just appear on a table, right?

What I know is whenever an inanimate object moves toward its destination, there has to be some sort of physical mechanisms like a conveyor belt, gears, propellers, sensors, etc.

So are there similar things within a cell? Does the medium where these objects pass over contain similar mechanism or system to guide them to their destination?

My name is Roger Hanlon, and I'm a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. I am a diving biologist who studies cephalopod behavior, especially camouflage &amp; signaling. I recently gave a [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_hanlon_the_amazing_brains_and_morphing_skin_of_octopuses_and_other_cephalopods) on the amazing brains and ""smart skin"" of octopuses and other cephalopods. My favorite cephalopod is Octopus cyanea, the ""day octopus"" of coral reefs throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This critter is really clever and adaptable, and its coloration for camouflage and signaling is amazing even by cephalopod standards.

I'm Mike Vecchione, a NOAA scientist at the National Museum of Natural History. My current research focuses on the natural history of cephalopods, and marine biodiversity, especially in the deep sea. I have helped to make cephalopod information available on the web [here](http://tolweb.org/cephalopoda). My favorite cephalopod is any strange species from the deep sea because we are still discovering new stuff regularly.

Hello all, I'm Louise Allcock! I'm head of zoology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and I'm particularly interested in the evolution and ecology of cephalopods. My favourite cephalopod is *Thaumeledone guntheri*. It's a deep-sea species from around the island South Georgia. I like the pattern on its skin! Lots of deep-sea species appear to have their origins in Antarctica and I'm fascinated by this.

We're doing this as part of [#CephalopodWeek](https://www.sciencefriday.com/spotlights/cephalopod-week/), the public radio show Science Friday's annual celebration of our favorite creatures.

We'll be answering questions from 1pm ET (17 UT). Ask us anything!

&lt;p&gt;My name is Roger Hanlon, and I&amp;#39;m a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. I am a diving biologist who studies cephalopod behavior, especially camouflage &amp;amp; signaling. I recently gave a &lt;a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_hanlon_the_amazing_brains_and_morphing_skin_of_octopuses_and_other_cephalopods""&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; on the amazing brains and &amp;quot;smart skin&amp;quot; of octopuses and other cephalopods. My favorite cephalopod is Octopus cyanea, the &amp;quot;day octopus&amp;quot; of coral reefs throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This critter is really clever and adaptable, and its coloration for camouflage and signaling is amazing even by cephalopod standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m Mike Vecchione, a NOAA scientist at the National Museum of Natural History. My current research focuses on the natural history of cephalopods, and marine biodiversity, especially in the deep sea. I have helped to make cephalopod information available on the web &lt;a href=""http://tolweb.org/cephalopoda""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite cephalopod is any strange species from the deep sea because we are still discovering new stuff regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I&amp;#39;m Louise Allcock! I&amp;#39;m head of zoology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and I&amp;#39;m particularly interested in the evolution and ecology of cephalopods. My favourite cephalopod is &lt;em&gt;Thaumeledone guntheri&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a deep-sea species from around the island South Georgia. I like the pattern on its skin! Lots of deep-sea species appear to have their origins in Antarctica and I&amp;#39;m fascinated by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re doing this as part of &lt;a href=""https://www.sciencefriday.com/spotlights/cephalopod-week/""&gt;#CephalopodWeek&lt;/a&gt;, the public radio show Science Friday&amp;#39;s annual celebration of our favorite creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be answering questions from 1pm ET (17 UT). Ask us anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;#39;re signing off now... Thanks for all the great questions, we wish we could&amp;#39;ve gotten to them all! And if you can&amp;#39;t get enough, Science Friday is &lt;a href=""https://www.sciencefriday.com/spotlights/cephalopod-week/""&gt;talking about cephalopods all week long&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

No one, it seems, has been able to figure out why this imbalance, dubbed the baryon asymmetry problem (or the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem) occurred, and many proposed theories, from hypothetical X and Y bosons that can violate the symmetry and lead to baryogenesis (the creation of matter independent of antimatter), to entire areas of the universe dominated by antimatter that are too far away to see, explaining away the missing antimatter; all of which so far have fallen flat in the search for experimental evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet all those theories, to my understanding, seem to take a strange assumption: that particles can only collide in pairs.

&amp;#x200B;

What if in the early universe some of the matter and antimatter particles collided in groups of three?  In my amateur research into the topic, I've read up that particle and antiparticle collisions are 100% efficient, and produce their entire mass worth of energy when equal amounts of particle are collided.  Under a collision of three particles, however, there seems to be little research I could find, most likely because such collisions are so rare in nature and experimentation (which as a side note could explain why so few matter particles, about one in a billion, survived).

&amp;#x200B;

Extrapolating what I know of how matter collisions work (please correct me if I'm wrong, I don't do this for a living), if a collision of 3 particles, let's say a certain particle *P* and two identical antiparticles *Q* such that the two *Q* particles' properties ""add"" up to be equivalent to the properties of the antimatter counterpart of *P*, then shouldn't all three particles get converted into energy just as if the particle-antiparticle pair of *P* would've collided instead?  The example may be a ways off from how it works, I'm no physicist, but I hope the gist of it comes through.

&amp;#x200B;

If such a scenario that I've described above is impossible, then is there another scenario such that an odd number of particles and its associated antiparticles can collide and completely be converted into energy with 100% efficiency?  If so, then could such three-particle collision be common enough to result in the slight difference in the ratio of matter to antimatter from baryogenesis?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early Universe there should&amp;#39;ve been an equal amount of matter and antimatter particles, as matter and antimatter particles always form in pairs as we&amp;#39;ve learned from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and elsewhere; yet there appears to be more matter than antimatter in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

"" **Electron-beam lithography** (often abbreviated as **e-beam lithography**) is the practice of scanning a focused beam of electrons to draw custom shapes on a surface covered with an electron-sensitive film called a resist (exposing""

"" The primary advantage of electron-beam lithography is that it can draw custom patterns (direct-write) with sub-10 nm resolution. This form of maskless lithography has high resolution and low throughput, limiting its usage to photomask fabrication, low-volume production of semiconductor devices, and research and development.

&amp;#x200B;

So from what I understand the goal is to create masks, which will later be used in photo-litography to create micro-chips. Is that correct? Because as far as I can tell this kind of maskless writing takes from 10-50 hrs PER MASK and that's waaay to slow to manufacture micro-chips themselves. But to create masks it might be just enough.

&amp;#x200B;

So can someone explain to me the basics steps? The way I see this now is:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get a silicon wafer
2. Put a resist on it
3. Write (without a mask) using an electron beam, anything you want on it.
4. Use something to dissolve the the rest of the resist such that only the part we illuminated with the e-beam remains on the silicon wafer.
5. Now we have created a mask.
6. Ship this mask to a micro-chip manufacturer.
7. The manufacturer will use photo-litography (regular light beam, short wavelenght) to illuminate the mask we shipped to him to create micro chips.

Is that more or less correct? Ps: I've noticed that some papers mention reverse e-beam litography. At what step of my list is that technology used?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety.
